QuadAir
=======

A Matlab implementation of the Compact Vortex Lattice Method, used to calculate the aerodynamics of fixed-wing aircraft.

**Cessna 152 Example**

Please read and run ExampleScript.m to get a quick idea of how to use QuadAir.  Also review Cessna152Example.m to learn how to define 
aircraft geometries.

Enjoy!
